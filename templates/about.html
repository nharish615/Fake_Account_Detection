	Online Social Media is dominating the world in several ways. Day by day the number
	of users using social media is increasing drastically. The main advantage of online 
	social media is that we can connect to people easily and communicate with them in a 
	better way. 

This provided a new way of a potential attack, such as fake identity, false information,
 etc. A recent survey suggests that the number of accounts present in the social media is
 much greater than the users using it. This suggests that fake accounts have been increased
 in the recent years. Online social media providers face difficulty in identifying these 
 fake accounts. <br><br>

The need for identifying these fake accounts is that social media is flooded with false 
information, advertisements, etc. Traditional methods cannot distinguish between real and 
fake accounts efficiently. Improvement in fake account creation made the previous works outdated. 

The new models created used different approaches such as automatic posts or comments, spreading
 false information or spam with advertisements to identify fake accounts. Due to the increase
 in the creation of the fake accounts different algorithms with different attributes are use.
 Previously use algorithms like na√Øve Bayes, support vector machine, random forest has become
 inefficient in finding the fake accounts. In this research, we came up with an innovative 
 method to identify fake accounts.
 <br><br>
we implement this technique to identify the malicious activities in social contact.

	To detect and avoid fake identities it is need to understand the dynamic contagion. In exist there
	are many models to detect the fake identities by bots or humans. Sybil identities are generally 
	focused on famous social media platforms. The proposed system discussed in this paper is to detect
	the Sybil and troll identities using machine learning engineered techniques</h3>
